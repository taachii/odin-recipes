  <h2>Description</h2>

  <p><strong>Carbonara</strong> </p>

  <p>With crispy bits of pork, a peppery bite, and a velvety cheese sauce enriched with eggs, carbonara is just as easy to make for dinner as it is at 2 a.m. after a long night out.</p>
  
  <p>It’s one of Rome’s signature dishes, and just like cacio e pepe and other pasta recipes in that class, its simplicity demands proper technique and quality ingredients.</p>
