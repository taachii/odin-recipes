  <h2>Description</h2>

  <div class="description-content content">
    <p><strong>Carbonara</strong> </p>

    <p>With crispy bits of pork, a peppery bite, and a velvety cheese sauce enriched with eggs, carbonara is just as easy to make for dinner as it is at 2 a.m. after a long night out.</p>
  
    <p>It’s one of Rome’s signature dishes, and just like cacio e pepe and other pasta recipes in that class, its simplicity demands proper technique and quality ingredients.</p>  
  </div>
  
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul class="ingredient-list content">
    <li>Kosher salt</li>
    <li>Pancetta / bacon</li>
    <li>Parmesan / Pecorino</li>
    <li>Large egg yolks</li>
    <li>Large eggs</li>
    <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
    <li>Olive oil</li>
    <li>Spaghetti / Bucatini / Rigatoni</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol class="step-list content">
   <li>Heat 6 qt. water in a large pot over high. When water starts to steam, add 3 Tbsp. salt and cover pot with a lid.</li>
   <li>While you are waiting on the water, do a little prep. Remove 4 oz. guanciale from packaging and cut into strips. Finely grate 2 oz. cheese and set aside one-quarter of cheese for later.</li>
   <li>Whisk 4 egg yolks and 2 whole eggs in a medium bowl until no streaks remain, then stir in remaining grated cheese. Add several cranks of pepper and set aside.</li>
   <li>Working next to pot, heat 2 Tbsp. oil in a large Dutch oven or other heavy pot over medium. Add guanciale and cook, stirring occasionally, until crisp around the edges, 7–10 minutes.</li>
   <li>Remove pot from heat. Using a wooden spoon, fish out guanciale and transfer to a small bowl. Pour fat into a heatproof measuring cup, then add back about 3 Tbsp. to pot. Discard any remaining fat.</li>
   <li>Cook 1 lb. pasta in boiling water, stirring occasionally, 2 minutes shy of package instructions. Just before pasta is finished, scoop out 1¾ cups pasta cooking liquid with same heatproof measuring cup.</li>
   <li>Add 1 cup reserved pasta cooking liquid to Dutch oven and bring to a boil over medium-high. Drain pasta in a colander, then transfer to Dutch oven.</li>
   <li>Cook pasta, stirring constantly and vigorously, until al dente and water is reduced by about half, about 2 minutes. Remove pot from heat.</li>
   <li>Whisk ¼ cup reserved pasta water into egg mixture, then very slowly stream into Dutch oven, stirring constantly, until cheese is melted and egg is thickened to form a glossy sauce. Season with salt, if needed. Thin sauce with remaining ½ cup pasta cooking liquid, adding a tablespoonful at a time, until it's the consistency of heavy cream (you most likely won’t use all of it).</li>
   <li>Mix in guanciale and divide pasta among bowls. Top with pepper and reserved cheese.</li>
  </ol>
