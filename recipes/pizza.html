  <h2>Description</h2>

  <p><strong>Pizza</strong> </p>
  <p>What to do when your 8-year old nephew comes to visit? Make pizza, of course!</p>

  <p>Well, not of course, actually. I didn't think of it until we exhausted Sorry, Monopoly, and gin rummy. But it did turn out to be a brilliant idea as my father had just received a baking stone for Christmas, and my nephew loves pizza.</p>
